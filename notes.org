* Amazon AWS notes
- if logging into my machine for the first time make sure to
  *export SSEC2_PROFILE=layerlab*

** Preparing the instance
*** Launching an i3.large instance
- *ssec2 launch -t i3.large -n bam_file_processing*
  
- -t is the type of instance
- -n is the name of the instance(?)
  
*** Connecting to the instance
- *ssec2 connect -l* to list the running instances
- *ssec2 connect -i name_of_instance*

*** Preparation Script
- after launching an instance of i3.large run the following
  *bash <(curl -s http://layerlab.org/aws/i3.sh)*

- (maybe run with *sudo*)

  This is just downloading a script hosted on Ryan's website and executing it
  in order to prepare instance with various bits of software.

- TODO look into the contents of the script and see if I can add some stuff 
  in there.  Maybe I should just download a local copy for my self and put
  on the git repo.
  
*** Install mosdepth
- install from
  https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth/releases/download/v0.2.4/mosdepth

- Just use *wget* to download the binary to desired location 
  */mnt/local/bin* will have been created during the setup script

- make sure it's on your path
  
- make sure to *chmod +x mosdepth*
